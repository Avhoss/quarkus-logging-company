# quarkus-logging-company
This is a showcase project demonstrating how to implement a Kafka-based logging system using **Quarkus 3.2.4** with **MSSQL** as the relational database. It includes producers and consumers for logging changes to entities like `Employee` and `Company`, which are persisted and tracked using `ChangeLog`.
